# Ralph Wiggum Loop Prompt

Read @AGENTS.md for session rules and landing-the-plane protocol.

## Your Task

1. **Check Status**: Run `bd ready` to see issues with no blockers
2. **Select One Issue**: Pick the highest-priority issue from ready work
3. **Claim It**: Run `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
4. **Log Start**: Add comment with your implementation plan: `bd comments add <id> "Starting work. Plan: <brief strategy>"`
5. **Implement**: Make the code changes described in the issue
6. **Log Progress**: After key milestones, update ticket: `bd comments add <id> "Progress: <what you completed>"`
7. **Verify**: Run tests, linting, or other verification appropriate to your project
8. **Log Verification**: Record verification results: `bd comments add <id> "Verification: <test results summary>"`
9. **Complete**: Run `bd close <id> --reason="<brief summary>"`
10. **Commit**: Stage and commit your changes with descriptive message
11. **Push**: Run `git pull --rebase && bd sync && git push` to preserve work

## Verification

Run the project's standard verification commands before committing. Common patterns:

| Check | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Tests | `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, `cargo test` |
| Lint | `npm run lint`, `ruff check .`, `golangci-lint run` |
| Types | `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy .`, `pyright` |
| Build | `npm run build`, `go build ./...`, `cargo build` |

Check `package.json`, `Makefile`, or project docs for exact commands.

## Issue Type Rules

**task** — Implement exactly what's specified:
- NO scope expansion
- All acceptance criteria must pass before closing
- Search the codebase first — don't assume something isn't already built
- If you discover additional work, create a new issue with `bd create`

**bug** — Reproduce, diagnose, fix:
- NO unrelated changes — fix only the bug
- Minimal, focused fix — don't refactor surrounding code
- Regression test is required
- If you discover related bugs, create new issues with `bd create --type=bug`

**epic/feature** — Milestone check:
- These are containers for related work
- Run `bd show <id>` to see child issues
- If all children are closed, close with `bd close <id> --reason="All child issues complete"`
- If children remain open, output `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` — the loop will retry later

## Important Rules

- **One issue per iteration** - Do not work on multiple issues
- **No partial work** - Either complete the issue fully or don't start it
- **Update tickets** - Use `bd comments add` to log progress
- **Run quality checks** - Always run verification before committing
- **Descriptive commits** - Include issue ID in commit message

## Ticket Update Guidelines

Keep ticket updates **succinct but informative**. Each comment should be 1-2 sentences max.

**Good examples:**
- `bd comments add <id> "Starting work. Plan: implement auth middleware, add tests, update docs"`
- `bd comments add <id> "Progress: auth middleware complete, 5/8 tests passing"`
- `bd comments add <id> "Verification: all tests pass, lint clean, types check"`

**Bad examples:**
- ❌ "Working on it" (not informative)
- ❌ "Starting work. I'm going to first read through the codebase to understand..." (too verbose)
- ❌ Long multi-paragraph explanations

## Completion Signal

When you have completed ONE issue successfully, output:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

If you encounter a blocker that prevents completion, add a comment explaining the blocker and output:

```
<promise>BLOCKED</promise>
```

## Dependencies

Issues may have dependencies. Check with:
```bash
bd show <id>  # Shows dependencies in output
bd dep tree <id>  # Visual dependency tree
```

Only work on issues that have no unresolved blockers (i.e., issues shown by `bd ready`).
